### Statistical Learning Methods

This is my note on *Statistical Learning Methods* by [Hang
Li](http://www.hangli-hl.com/index.html). 

Handwritten notes are in Chinese, but may be translated into English in the future. The algorithms are implented by `python` with plain `numpy`, and `pandas` to read data.
